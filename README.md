Hello and welcome to my first project, Simple Simon! A Simon Says
game with a simple, clean design.

## Features

This game features reactive, light up buttons that will respond when clicked or held. Also featured under the instructions button, is a pop-up set of instructions that are in no way impeded by the game boprad, so you can read them in peace. when starting the game, the instructions will automatically find themselves back under the instructions button for later use.

## Bronze Level

At bronze level, this game was a square with 4 boxes. The boxes were colored and lit up all at once depending on the determined computer input. The user had input saved depending on which buttons were pressed. Refreshing the page reset both. The player could move on as long as the first button matches and the sequence length matches. The game was functional, but not yet playable.

## Silver Level

At silver level, the game had a functioning start button which reset the game, and a set interval for the buttons to light up in a sequence. The buttons had a much better look to them when lighting up, and needed to be pressed in the exact order, or game over would appear at the end of the sequence. Buttons at this point light up only when pressed or held by the user, or showing computer sequence. Instructions were displayed on the page.

## Gold Level

At gold level, there is still some left to be desired for future updates. As of now, the game has improved very much stylistically. The instructions now appear only when called by their labeled button under the title, and the game has been been completely redisigned to be larger, but still fit an average computer browser. The game is now more reminiscent of the original Simon game currently owned by Hasbro. The background has been applied to appear as a wood grain table top. The title and instructions have been given an attractive background to continue to be readable without being too gaudy, or showy.

#### Future Features

Functions yet to be added:

- A sound to be played during either button press or sequence play.
- A scoreboard displaying both current score, and all-time high score.
- Font changes.
- A native screnn to pop-up when user loses.

## Technologies Used

A standard implementation of:

- Javascript
